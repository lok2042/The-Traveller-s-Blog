            New York, often called New York City to distinguish it from New York
            State, or NYC for short, is the most populous city in the United
            States. With a 2020 population of 8,804,190 distributed over 302.6
            square miles (784 km<sup>2</sup>), New York City is also the most
            densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the
            southern tip of the State of New York, the city is the center of the
            New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the
            world by urban area. With almost 20 million people in its
            metropolitan statistical area and approximately 23 million in its
            combined statistical area, it is one of the world's most populous
            megacities. New York City has been described as the cultural,
            financial, and media capital of the world, significantly influencing
            commerce, entertainment, research, technology, education, politics,
            tourism, art, fashion, and sports, and is the most photographed city
            in the world. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New
            York is an important center for international diplomacy, and has
            sometimes been called the capital of the world.

            Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York
            City is composed of five boroughs, each of which is a county of the
            State of New York. The five boroughs are as followed:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Brooklyn</li>
            <li>Queens</li>
            <li>Manhattan</li>
            <li>the Bronx</li>
            <li>Staten Island</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The five boroughs were created when local governments were
            consolidated into a single city in 1898. The city and its
            metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal
            immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are
            spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city
            in the world. New York is home to more than 3.2 million residents
            born outside the United States, the largest foreign-born population
            of any city in the world as of 2016. As of 2019, the New York
            metropolitan area is estimated to produce a gross metropolitan
            product (GMP) of $2.0 trillion. If the New York metropolitan area
            were a sovereign state, it would have the eighth-largest economy in
            the world. New York is home to the highest number of billionaires of
            any city in the world.

            Yellowstone National Park is an American national park located in
            the western United States, largely in the northwest corner of
            Wyoming and extending into Montana and Idaho. It was established by
            the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant
            on March 1, 1872.Yellowstone was the first national park in the U.S.
            and is also widely held to be the first national park in the world.
            The park is known for its wildlife and its many geothermal features,
            especially Old Faithful geyser, one of its most popular. While it
            represents many types of biomes, the subalpine forest is the most
            abundant. It is part of the South Central Rockies forests ecoregion.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Native Americans have lived in the Yellowstone region for at
            least 11,000 years, aside from visits by mountain men during the
            early-to-mid-19th century, organized exploration did not begin until
            the late 1860s. Management and control of the park originally fell
            under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of the
            Interior, the first Secretary of the Interior to supervise the park
            being Columbus Delano. However, the U.S. Army was eventually
            commissioned to oversee management of Yellowstone for a 30-year
            period between 1886 and 1916. In 1917, administration of the park
            was transferred to the National Park Service, which had been created
            the previous year. Hundreds of structures have been built and are
            protected for their architectural and historical significance, and
            researchers have examined more than a thousand archaeological sites.

            Yellowstone National Park spans an area of 3,468.4 sq mi (8,983
            km<sup>2</sup>), comprising lakes, canyons, rivers, and mountain
            ranges. Yellowstone Lake is one of the largest high- elevation lakes
            in North America and is centered over the Yellowstone Caldera, the
            largest supervolcano on the continent. The caldera is considered a
            dormant volcano. It has erupted with tremendous force several times
            in the last two million years. Well over half of the world's geysers
            and hydrothermal features are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing
            volcanism. Lava flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most
            of the land area of Yellowstone. The park is the centerpiece of the
            Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the largest remaining nearly-intact
            ecosystem in the Earth's northern temperate zone. In 1978,
            Yellowstone was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hundreds of species of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and
            amphibians have been documented, including several that are either
            endangered or threatened. The vast forests and grasslands also
            include unique species of plants. Yellowstone Park is the largest
            and most famous megafauna location in the contiguous United States.
            Grizzly bears, wolves, and free-ranging herds of bison and elk live
            in this park. The Yellowstone Park bison herd is the oldest and
            largest public bison herd in the United States. Forest fires occur
            in the park each year; in the large forest fires of 1988, nearly one
            third of the park was burnt. Yellowstone has numerous recreational
            opportunities, including hiking, camping, boating, fishing, and
            sightseeing. Paved roads provide close access to the major
            geothermal areas as well as some of the lakes and waterfalls. During
            the winter, visitors often access the park by way of guided tours
            that use either snow coaches or snowmobiles.

            Kuala Lumpur is the cultural, financial and economic centre of
            Malaysia. It is also home to the Parliament of Malaysia and the
            official residence of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the Istana Negara.
            Kuala Lumpur first developed around 1857 as a town serving the tin
            mines of the region and served as the capital of Selangor from 1880
            until 1978. Kuala Lumpur was the founding capital of the Federation
            of Malaya and its successor Malaysia and the city remained the seat
            of the executive and judicial branches of the Malaysian federal
            government until these were relocated to Putrajaya in early 1999.
            However, some sections of the political bodies still remain in Kuala
            Lumpur.
